Cindy version 0.01
==================

This module provides an XML based template engine that moves data
from an XML/HTML data source into an XML/HTML template. How this
is done is described by a Content INjection sheet. A content 
injection sheet loosely resembles a CSS style sheet.

To use this module with apache 2 writing perl is not required.
The module can configured from .htaccess files.

The current status is alpha. Use cases to improve the interface
are needed.
